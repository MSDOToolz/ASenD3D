# ASenD3D

ASenD3D (Adjoint-based Sensitivity and Design in 3D) is a tool for performing finite element analysis of structural systems and computing sensitivities of structural objectives to design parameters/variables using the adjoint method.  High-efficiency, high-fidelity gradient-based optimization and uncertainty quantification in structural design are the primary intended applications, but the package functions as a general open-source finite element analysis tool.  Capabilities include analysis of elastic and thermal response of 3D solid, shell and beam structures under loading, as well as modal analysis for natural frequency and buckling problems.

Originally created at the University of Wyoming under government-funded research projects and formerly known as AStrO (Adjoint-based Structural Optimizer), ASenD3D continues to expand, with recent efforts in improving efficiency and usability of interface.  Several python-based utilities are under development to promote ease and covenience of use and integration with other packages such as optimizers and meshing tools.  These remain a work-in-progress and will come online in the months ahead.

Basic examples of usage are provided for starters as the public repository undergoes construction.  Users are encouraged to try these out and familiarize themselves, and seek to make contributions as they feel inclined.
